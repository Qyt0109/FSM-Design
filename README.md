There are at least seven different Finite State Machine (FSM) design techniques. This repository will describe four of the FSM design techniques:
- 1 Always Block Style with registered outputs,
- 2 Always Block Style with combinatorial outputs,
- 3 Always Block Style with registered outputs, and
- 4 Always Block Style with registered outputs
